Babylon.Color3 color picker with 0-1 RGB values.
===========



This is a page I created to assist me in building interactive webGL pages with Babylon.js. Babylon's Color3 class needs rgb values between 0 and 1, and I got tired of picking colors, dividing each value by 255 before I could include them in code. 


The color picker itself is cloned from: [http://www.daviddurman.com/flexi-color-picker](http://www.daviddurman.com/flexi-color-picker)


I created a github page with one of the repo's examples, and added inputs to calculate the rgb 0 - 1.0 values to display on the page. There are minor scripting and style updates to the example, but all other credit goes to daviddurman.com/flexi-color-picker.
